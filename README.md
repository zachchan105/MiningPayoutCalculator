Why use this program?

    Back in high school, I accumulated a lot of friends who wanted to get started into mining. However, meeting minimum payout for most
    pools makes it a very long and boring process. A lot of my friends decided they would all mine to one address so that they could meet
    minimum payout faster. They ran into problems when trying to calculate how much to pay each person. This simple calculator solves those
    problems by precicely calculating how much each rig earned in the specified cryptocurrency.
